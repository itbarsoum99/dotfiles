# Linux Dotfiles

These dotfiles are compatible with openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed, beginning at stable version 15.1. 

They include configurations for the tmux terminal multiplexer, the vim text editor, the bash shell, and the lynx terminal web browser. 

These were created with the guidance of Rob Muhlestein and the original files are under the public domain.

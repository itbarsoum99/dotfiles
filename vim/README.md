# Vim Dotfiles Setup
__

The vim dotfiles in this directory provide aesthetic and functional
improvements to the VIM editor. In order to implement the dotfiles,
use `chmod 700` to give permission to the `setup.sh` file to create
a symbolic link between these dotfiles and the .vimrc file located in
the `$HOME` directory.

Once the files have the proper permissions, run `./setup.sh` to
implement the dotfiles.
